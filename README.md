## Assignment 01: Set up and prerequisites

1. Git
- Install git.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

- You may see references to the stand alone app for git on your desktop. That's not what we're using for this course.

- Watch the videos in this series that you need to watch (seriously, even if you've been working with git for a while, it's sometimes handy to revisit, e.g., the difference between git and Github). They are on youtube. If you don't have a subscription, it will pop up with short ads. Sorry, but these are really decent videos. There's about 30 min total.

* Excellent in data representation, computer architecture and organization
* Strong coding skills using Python and SQL, including standard data libraries such as pandas, SQL Alchemy etc.
* Cloud experience desired, Azure or AWS
* Needed experience with big data tools such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, etc

   A solid experience and understanding of considerations for planning, scaling, deployment and operations that are unique to Hadoop, NoSQL and other emerging modern data technologies is required. We are looking for candidates who have a broad set of skills across these areas and who can demonstrate an ability to identify and apply modern data and cloud technologies to architect and implement innovative and differentiated data solutions. Data Engineers are expected to work with our clients in defining the future state architectures of their data platforms enabling analytical intelligence and then play a lead role to implement a roadmap to reach that state.
